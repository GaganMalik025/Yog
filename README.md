We have created an app Yog. It helps to correct your yoga postures. It uses Tensorflow posture estimation API to detect key points of the human body in a video stream. Then the posture is matched with the images of yoga postures. The application tells what percentage of body posture is matched with that in the image.
We refer to pose detection API by TensorFlow : https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/posenet/android
